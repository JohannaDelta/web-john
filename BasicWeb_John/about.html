	<h2> About </h2>
	<p class="text"> <span class="span2"> John Doe </span> is a photographer, long established in the industry. He uses a very grainy style of printing to help convey his interpretation of the world. Working in mostly 35 & 120mm black and white, he is one of the few remaining film photographers. He uses a very fly on the wall view, choosing and searching for images that few other people see. <br><br> John Doe started his photography career, while studying design at college. He qualified as a designer but slowly his photography became more important and slowly changed his career path. He worked mainly in the area of fine art, but does do some professional shoots. His work is housed in many permanent private and public galleries worldwide. His photographs have been printed in many<span class="span3"> magazines like National Geographic, Magnum, and many more.</span><br><br><br> 
	I didn’t set out to be a photographer. It just kind of happened. I started photography at college as a support module to my design degree. It became an avenue for me to support my design work, and slowly became something that became a hobby. I ended up carrying a camera everywhere with me, and slowly found I was spending more time in the darkroom than in the studio. I got a gift of a very old 120 roll film camera, which created a new style and medium for me, it allowed me to explore new avenues, and textures. I spend so much time in the dark room, just exploring texture, and grains, contrast and techniques. What can I say? It is a passion.
	I have spent a lot of time reflecting on things such as what is my “style” of photography. Style comes with time and is a difficult thing to force. I think more important than style is being aware of the literal nature of the image I see and striving to go beyond that in an aesthetic sense to create a captivating image.</p>
